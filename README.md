- 👋 Hi, I’m Aritra, a graduate student in physics at the University of Maryland, College Park.
- 👀 I’m interested in deep learning theory and applications of physics to deep learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some aspects of ML theory research. Some of these include:
   - kernel methods
   - attention mechanism
   - DL theory at initialization
- 📫 You can reach me at aritrad@umd.edu
